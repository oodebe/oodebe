This module also has automatic master process selection.\n\nCompatibility\n=============\n\nThis module uses broadcast and multicast features from node's dgram module. All \nrequired features of the dgram module are implemented in the following versions of node\n\n\t- v0.4.x\n\t- v0.6.9+\n\n\nExample\n=======\n\nBe sure to look in the examples folder, especially at the [distributed event\nemitter](https://github.com/wankdanker/node-discover/blob/master/examples/deventemitter.js)\n\n\n\tvar Discover = require('node-discover');\n\n\tvar d = new Discover();\n\n\td.on(\"promotion\", function () {\n\t\t/* \n\t\t * Launch things this master process should do.\n\t\t * \n\t\t * For example:\n\t\t *\t- Monitior your redis servers and handle failover by issuing slaveof\n\t\t *    commands then notify other node instances to use the new master\n\t\t *\t- Make sure there are a certain number of nodes in the cluster and \n\t\t *    launch new ones if there are not enough\n\t\t *\t- whatever\n\t\t * \n\t\t */\n\t\t \n\t\tconsole.log(\"I was promoted to a master.\");\n\t});\n\n\td.on(\"demotion\", function () {\n\t\t/*\n\t\t * End all master specific functions or whatever you might like. \n\t\t *\n\t\t */\n\t\t\n\t\tconsole.log(\"I was demoted from being a master.\");\n\t});\n\n\td.on(\"added\", function (obj) {\n\t\tconsole.log(\"A new node has been added.\");\n\t});\n\n\td.on(\"removed\", function (obj) {\n\t\tconsole.log(\"A node has been removed.\");\n\t});\n\n\td.on(\"master\", function (obj) {\n\t\t/*\n\t\t * A new master process has been selected\n\t\t * \n\t\t * Things we might want to do:\n\t\t * \t- Review what the new master is advertising use its services\n\t\t *\t- Kill all connections to the old master\n\t\t */\n\t\t \n\t\tconsole.log(\"A new master is in control\");\n\t});\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\n### npm\n\n\tnpm install node-discover\n\n### git\n\n\tgit clone git://github.com/wankdanker/node-discover.git\n\n\nAPI\n===\n\nConstructor\n-----------\n\n\tnew Discover({\n\t\thelloInterval\t: How often to broadcast a hello packet in milliseconds; Default: 1000\n\t\tcheckInterval\t: How often to to check for missing nodes in milliseconds; Default: 2000\n\t\tnodeTimeout\t: Consider a node dead if not seen in this many milliseconds; Default: 2000\n\t\tmasterTimeout\t: Consider a master node dead if not seen in this many milliseconds; Default: 2000\n\t\taddress\t\t: Address to bind to; Default: '0.0.0.0'\n\t\tport\t\t: Port on which to bind and communicate with other node-discover processes; Default: 12345\n\t\tbroadcast\t: Broadcast address if using broadcast; Default: '255.255.255.255'\n\t\tmulticast\t: Multicast address if using multicast; Default: null (don't use multicast, use broadcast)\n\t\tmulitcastTTL : Multicast TTL for when using multicast; Default: 1\n\t\tkey\t\t: Encryption key if your broadcast packets should be encrypted; Default: null (that means no encryption);\n\t\tmastersRequired\t: The count of master processes that should always be available,\n\t\tweight\t\t: A number used to determine the preference for a specific process to become master.
